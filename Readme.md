This is a simple Navigation Menu in ReactJS, I am new to react and this is my first project. Pordon me if you find the UI bit Clumsy. I had created my project with Reacts Create-app npm extension.<br/>

<b>File structure</b>            <br/><br/>
<b>src folder:</b> <br/>
index.js  // Component which grabs the DOM element and push our components<br/>
index.css // css file just for changing the color of menu <br/>
data.json // Content of the Navigation Menu in JSON format<br/>
NavBar.js // this contains our components<br/>

<b>Public folder:  </b> <br/>
index.html<br/>

To implement this Navigation bar in your project, Although you would do it. You just have ot follow simple steps. <br/>
Add the NavBar component to you File. Nav Bar component is gettting the data from Json file.<br/>

JSON file explained: It has an array of opbject : index 0: is the values that appear on the main Navigation bar. <br/>
following Objects are the values that appear for indivaidual items.<br/>
For example: index 0 : have "Home","AboutUS","Service","Contact"<br/>

So now we will have 4 more objects having the values that shuold be displayed for each individual element.<br/>
