This is a simple Navigation Menu in ReactJS, I am new to react and this is my first project. Pordon me if you find the UI bit Clumsy. I had created my project with Reacts Create-app npm extension.

File structure
src folder: 
index.js  // Component which grabs the DOM element and push our components
index.css 
data.json // Content of the Navigation Menu in JSON format
NavBar.js // this contains our components

Public folder:
index.html

To implement this Navigation bar in your project, Although you would do it. You just have ot follow simple steps. 
Add the NavBar component to you File. Nav Bar component is gettting the data from Json file.

JSON file explained: It has an array of opbject : index 0: is the values that appear on the main Navigation bar. 
following Objects are the values that appear for indivaidual items.
For example: index 0 : have "Home","AboutUS","Service","Contact"

So now we will have 4 more objects having the values that shuold be displayed for each individual element.
