This is a simple Navigation Menu in ReactJS, I am new to react and this is my first project. Pordon me if you find the UI bit clumsy. I have created my project with Reacts Create-app npm method.With this way all the necessary file are downloaded in you project and you can get started building ReactJS application within seconds<br/>

<b>File structure</b>            <br/><br/>
<b>src folder:</b> <br/>
index.js  // Component which grabs the DOM element and push our components<br/>
index.css // css file just for changing the color of menu <br/>
data.json // content of the Navigation Menu in JSON format<br/>
NavBar.js // this contains our components<br/>

<b>Public folder:  </b> <br/>
index.html<br/>

To implement this Navigation bar in your project, although you will not do it. You just have to follow simple steps given below. <br/>
Add the NavBar component to you File. Nav Bar component is gettting the data from Json file.<br/>

JSON file explained: <br/>
It has an array of objects. At index 0 is the values that appear on the main Navigation bar. <br/>
following Objects are the values that appear for indivaidual items.<br/>
For example: index 0 : have "Home","AboutUS","Service","Contact"<br/>
So now we will have 4 more objects having the values that should be displayed for each individual element.<br/>
